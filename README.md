## Overview
A deep learningâ€“based monitoring system that detects inactivity, abnormal movement, and triggers alerts for elderly individuals.

## Features
- DNN model for activity detection
- Flask web interface
- Real-time alert simulation
- Deployable on Render/Heroku

## Dataset
- UCI "Activity Recognition with Healthy Older People" Dataset
- Alternative: "AI for Elderly Care and Support" from Kaggle
- A small `sample.csv` is provided for quick testing only.


## How to Run
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python model/train_model.py
- python app.py


## Deployment
Deploy using Flask + Render or Heroku. Add requirement.txt and Procfile for deployment.
